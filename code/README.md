# Technigo React Starter App

This app has been generated using `create-react-app`, then cleaned up a little so we have a project with just the elements we need to get started.

Add components in the `src` folder and use them in `src/app.js` to get started.

## how to do this:

 - Your page should follow the design as closely as possible
// - You should list the most recent thoughts at the top and older thoughts at the bottom (sorted)
// - Your thoughts should show the content of the message and how many likes they've received
// - You should have a form to post new thoughts
// - You should implement the heart button to send likes on a thought

//1. what kind of components you need, what their responsibility 
// 2.and what kind of state you'll need
// 3.start with listing the thoughts which are already in the API. 4.Then move on to building a form to post a new thought, 
// 5. and finally implement the heart button on an existing thought.

// When you submit the form to add a new thought, the API returns the new thought object in the same way it would look if it was part of the full list response. You can use this to avoid having to send a second API request to fetch all thoughts again after submitting a new thought. See the [react documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate) for a more detailed explanation of adding an object to an existing array in state, but in a nutshell, you'll want to do something like this:


1. On GitHub, click the 'use this template' button to create a new repo on your account
1. Clone the new repo to your computer
1. Install required dependencies with npm: `npm install`
1. Start the project: `npm start`

Alternatively, if you don't want a new git repo on your account;

1. Download & extract the [latest release](https://github.com/Technigo/react-starter/releases/latest) from GitHub
1. Open the directory in the terminal: `cd /path/to/react-starter`
1. Install required dependencies with npm: `npm install`
1. Start the project: `npm start`
